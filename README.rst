Introduction
------------

This is library for building adminstrative interface on top of Flask framework.

Instead of providing simple scaffolding for the database models, Flask-Admin
provides tools that can be used to build adminstrative interface of any complexity,
using consistent look and feel.

Flask-Admin comes with following batteries out of the box:

- SQLAlchemy model scaffolding
- MongoEngine model scaffolding
- Peewee model scaffolding
- File admin
